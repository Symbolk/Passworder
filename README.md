## Introduction

As Netizens, we have to register and sign in again and again ceaselessly in all kinds of websites or apps. 

Maintaining various accounts and passwords for different services may be a wise and safe habit, but in this way our mind will be filled with countless complicated strings, which is indeed burden and misery. 

I often forget my password or account when signing in, so I have to click "Forget password?" to reset it, but it happens the next time. I hate this, so I am building such a tool to manage my accounts and passwords---of course, inessential ones!!!


## Main Features

1, Key and Super Password

* You have to set one super password, which can unlock your repository.

* This is EXTREMELY important, so you must learn it by heart!

* Reset is possible---in case you forget it too unfortunately.

2, Category

* You can categorize your accounts and passwords in various domains:

shopping, social networks, emails, e.t.c.

3, Questions&Answers

* If some one get your key and super password, they still have to answer several questions before your secrets get exposed.

* Make sure that these questions can only get answered correctly by you!
